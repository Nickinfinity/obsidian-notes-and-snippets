/**
 * `force: true` may be spelled in exactly one place.
 *
 * `force` is the single flag standing between "write a new artifact" and
 * "overwrite whatever is already there". The Variables **edit** path needs it —
 * the user is editing a file that exists. Every other path must not have it:
 * the Wave 4 batch writer is explicitly forbidden `force`, because overwriting a
 * user's artifact is not a batch decision, and a collision there must degrade to
 * a skip.
 *
 * Same idiom as `varset-scanner-singleton.test.ts` and `flags.service.test.ts`:
 * the fact lives in the shape of the code, so a source grep is the check that
 * can actually fail.
 *
 * **Comments are stripped before matching**, and that is not a nicety. The
 * first version of this guard failed on `createIndexRunner.ts` — whose JSDoc
 * states that it *never* passes `force: true`. A grep that cannot tell code
 * from prose flags the file documenting the rule it enforces, which is the
 * same defect as the T0 placeholder gate (ledger #29): a check that fires on
 * its own documentation is not a check.
