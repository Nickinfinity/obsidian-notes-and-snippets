/**
 * Drift guard: no per-type branching on the create path (VSX-214).
 *
 * The create path — `create-from-surface.command.ts`, the three `capture/`
 * modules, the `mainView.*` renderers, the index runner and its plan service,
 * and the create form's own HTML builder — is designed so that adding a new
 * `ARTIFACTS` entry needs no new branch here: every decision reads
 * `getEntry`/`getLanguageMode`/`getFilenameField`/`writesWholeFile` etc. from
 * `artifact-type-config.service.ts` instead of comparing `type` against a
 * literal. A `type === 'Snippet'` (or a `switch` case, or its Yoda-reversed
 * form) creeping back in is exactly the regression those services exist to
 * prevent, so it gets a source-grep test rather than a comment asserting the
 * same thing (`CLAUDE.md` — "an invariant stated in a comment is not an
 * invariant").
 *
 * Type literals are read from `ARTIFACTS` itself (never hand-copied), so a
 * new artifact type is covered automatically without touching this file.
 *
 * **Comments are stripped before matching.** Same trap `flags.service.test.ts`
 * and `force-write-containment.test.ts` both hit: several files in this exact
 * set document "never a `type === 'AIPrompt'` literal" in JSDoc precisely
 * because they obey this rule, so the file most carefully explaining the
 * invariant is the guard's first false positive if comments are not removed
 * first (confirmed here — `capture/terminal.capture.ts` spells the raw pattern
 * inside its own JSDoc; a version of this guard with `stripComments` reduced
 * to a pass-through goes red on that line alone).
 *
 * ponytail: this is a regex scan, not an AST walk, so it has a real ceiling —
 * it cannot see `const S = 'Snippet'; t === S` (const indirection, incl. via
 * `switch`), a `Record<ArtifactType, …>` / object-map lookup keyed by type
 * (the one most likely to actually recur — a per-type lookup table is the
 * natural way to add a per-type fact, and it contains no comparison at all),
 * `[...].includes(t)`, `t.startsWith(...)`, a regex `.test(t)`, `Object.is`,
 * or loose `==` (which `eqeqeq` only warns on, and `eslint src` exits 0 on
 * warnings). Upgrade path if one of these actually recurs: an AST scan
 * (ts-morph or the TS compiler API) over identifier bindings and switch
 * discriminants instead of a text pattern.
