 * entry, in the right group, with the right `when`. What a static pin cannot
 * catch is `extension.ts` never calling `registerCreateSurfaceCommands`, or the
 * view provider never being registered: the manifest stays perfectly correct,
 * every menu entry renders, and clicking one raises "command not found" with
 * the whole manifest suite green.
 *
 * That was the live state of this branch until Wave 1 close — eight contributed
 * menu entries, none of them wired, and no test that could tell. This suite is
