/**
 * Drift guard: one `VarSetScanner` **instance**, not merely one class.
 *
 * `VarSetScanner` caches its recursive scan, so a second instance is a second
 * cache — and each is invalidated by only one of the two writers. T13 shipped
 * exactly that: a private scanner in the Variables tree meant Save-as-Variable-Set
 * left the tree stale, and the tree's own refresh left the Apply-Variable-Set
 * QuickPick stale. Both caches were "correct"; they just disagreed.
 *
 * Cache *identity* is not observable from a fixture test, so this is a source
 * grep instead — the same idiom `flags.service.test.ts` and
 * `path-containment.test.ts` already use for facts that live in the shape of
 * the code rather than its behaviour. Every consumer calls `getVarSetScanner()`.
