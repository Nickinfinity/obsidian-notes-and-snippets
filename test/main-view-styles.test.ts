 * Pins the main pane's stylesheet arrays — **order, not membership**.
 *
 * Every rule in `main-view.css` is single-class specificity, so nothing but
 * source order decides whether the narrow-pane reflow wins over `picker.css`.
 * A membership-only assertion passes against an array that ships the sheets in
 * an order where the reflow silently does nothing, which is the failure ledger
 * #109 records: the pane was built against two sheets while the preview needs
 * six, and a green suite proved nothing because the CSS loaded fine and simply
 * had nothing to override.
