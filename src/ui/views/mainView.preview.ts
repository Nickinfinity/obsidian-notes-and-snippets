 * could return `false` and bail — would silently drop the first post into a
 * view that does not exist yet. This awaits `target.focus()` (which performs
 * the reveal) and then **re-reads `target.resolved()`** rather than trusting
 * the call succeeded: `focus()`'s contract is "reveal and wait for
 * resolution", but nothing here enforces that a caller actually implements
 * it that way (e.g. wiring bare `executeCommand('obsidian-artifacts.mainView.focus')`,
 * whose returned promise settles when the reveal command completes, not when
 * `resolveWebviewView` fires) — so a `focus()` that returns without the view
 * ever resolving must surface as a thrown error, not a silent success a
 * caller then posts into.
 *
 * @param target - The pane's current resolution state and its reveal action.
 * @returns Resolves once the view is confirmed resolved — either already, or
 *          after `focus()` settles and `resolved()` confirms it.
 * @throws  If `focus()` rejects, or if it resolves without `resolved()`
 *          becoming `true`.

 * await ensureView({ resolved: () => this.view !== undefined, focus: () => revealMainView() });

 * `renderCodeRowsHtml` / `renderCodeHtml` calls `preview.ts` makes. No second

 * own — swapping `webview.html` to this string is a full document reload,
 * so it never collides with `idle` mode's script from the previous render.
 *
 * ORCH-7 wires this into `mainView.provider.ts`'s `render()`, replacing its

 * ```ts
 * renderMainViewPreviewHtml(this.previewState, cssUris, webview.cspSource, getNonce())

 * owns, defaulting to `{ kind: 'empty' }` and updated by whatever routes an
 * accepted artifact into the pane (navigator.ts, ORCH-7 row 2). Ending
 * preview (Cancel, or Insert for a non-batch artifact) is the same call
 * site's job too: `setMode('idle')` where the reused controller currently
 * calls the popup's `dispose()`.
 *
 * @param state     - What to show — `empty`, a single-block artifact, or a multi-block artifact.
 * @param cssUri    - Webview URIs for the shared stylesheets (`base.css` first).
 * @param cspSource - Webview CSP source token (`webview.cspSource`).
 * @param nonce     - CSP nonce for `renderPreviewHtml`'s `<script>` tag; unused by the other two states.
 * @returns Complete HTML document string, ready for `webview.html`.
