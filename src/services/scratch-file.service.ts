/**
 * THE authority for scratch files — real files written into extension storage
 * so the user can edit them with the full VS Code editor, then have them
 * deleted on teardown. Layout: `<storageUri>/<subdir>/<slug>.<ext>`.
 *
 * Extracted from `artifactPicker/blockEditor.ts`'s `<storageUri>/blockEdit/`
 * temp-file behaviour and generalised to an arbitrary `subdir`, so future
 * scratch-file callers share one authority instead of a second copy of the
 * containment dance.
 *
 * **Not the same thing as `TempDocument`** (`temp-document.service.ts`), which
 * wraps an *untitled* `vscode.TextDocument` — no path, nothing on disk,
 * nothing to sweep. This service owns real files on disk, which is why it has
 * containment checks, slugging, and an orphan sweep, and `TempDocument` has
 * none of them. Neither absorbs the other.

 * immediately before the write, with nothing in between.
